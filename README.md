# Beverage-Impact-on-Problem-Solving-STA305H5S2025
Group project for STA305: Experimental Design @ University of Toronto Mississauga in Winter of 2025.

The aim of this project was to create and implement a research projects using proper experimental design techniques and statistical tests learned in STA305. 

Our project investiagtes the effects of caffeinated and non-caffeinated coffee and energy drinks on problem solving skills of virtual participants using The Islands, a virtual population developed by the University of Queensland for testing in experimental design. We designed the experiment, gathered data, and analyzed it. The final results of the study can be found in the the_residuals_technical_report.qmd file.
